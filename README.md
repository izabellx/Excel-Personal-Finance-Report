# Personal Finance Report

expenses, and savings, it is difficult to make informed financial decisions. This lack of insight can lead to overspending, 
insufficient savings, and unachieved financial goals. The aim of this report is to provide a comprehensive and systematic 
approach to tracking and analyzing personal financial data, enabling users to gain better control over their finances.

going. The report includes summaries of income and expenses by month and year, helping users identify trends and patterns
in their spending and savings habits. Detailed breakdowns of spending by category allow users to see which areas they spend 
the most on and where they might be able to cut back. Users can set financial goals and track their progress over time, 
motivating them to stay on track and achieve their objectives. The Main Dashboard provides visual summaries that make it easy
